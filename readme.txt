Embedding Instagram posts is broken at the moment. This plugin provides a temporary and dirty solution.

I will push an update with a "delete me" message once Instagram fixes the problem on their side.

And yes, it is really dirty - it forces WordPress to always embed media with more than 613 pixels on either side, which might and probably will create problems with other external services. Use at your own risk.
